# Library Management System
Management software for monitoring and controlling the transactions in a library .The project “Library Management System” is developed in Java, which mainly focuses on basic operations in a library like adding new books, and updating new information, searching books and members and return books.

This project of “LIBRARY MANAGEMENT” of gives us the complete information about the library. We can enter the record of new books and retrieve the details of books available in the library. We can issue the books to the members and maintain their records and can also check how many books are issued and stock available in the library. In this project we can maintain the late fine of members who returns the issued books after the due date.

Throughout the project the focus has been on presenting information and comments in an easy and intelligible manner. The project is very useful for those who want to know about Library Management System
